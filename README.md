# quantQ

The repository for the Machine Learning and Big Data with kdb+/q book by Novotny et al.

Order the book at https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Machine+Learning+and+Big+Data+with+KDB%2B+Q-p-9781119404750.

## Getting Started

```
$ cd quantQ/lib
$ q quantQ.q -p 5000
```

The naming convention for each .q file reflects the corresponding book chapter and the functions it defines reside under an homonymous namespace, as outlined in Section 3.1.0.1.

## Errata

### Chapter 14: Time Series Econometrics

| Section       | Note                
| ------------- |--------------------
| 14.1.6.1      | Ordering of ```phi``` vector inside implementation of  ```.quantQ.ts.simAR``` should be reversed to be in line with definition 14.1 and example on page 276. Adressed in repo. Variation of the function using adverbs also provided, under ```.quantQ.tse.simAR``` 
     

### Chapter 15: Fourier Transform

| Section       | Note                
| ------------- |-------------------- 
| 15.3          | Example following implementation of the Hamilton product (15.29-15.32) should read as ```.quantQ.quat.mult[quat1;quat3]```. Definition of ```.quantQ.quat.mult``` has a typo which is fixed in the repo
